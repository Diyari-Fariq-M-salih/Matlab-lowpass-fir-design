I. Aim of the program
→ Explain that it generates a sine wave in time and computes/displays its FFT (frequency content).

II. Time observation range
→ Read it from t = 0:Tech:2; → from 0 to 2 s.

III. Type of signal
→ It’s a pure sinusoidal signal of frequency 10 Hz (from sin(2*pi*10*t)).

IV. Spectral component
→ From the FFT plot, identify the peak at 10 Hz and explain why there is only one main frequency (pure sinus).

V. Why only half-plane?
→ Explain that, for a real signal, the spectrum is symmetric, so we only plot positive frequencies.
